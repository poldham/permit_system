## The Model

The development of the ABS Permit system is based on a model and schematics that are available at [http://poldham.github.io/abs_permits/](http://poldham.github.io/abs_permits/). This folder contains copies of the pdf and word documents outlining the model. The schematics are also available and should be viewed in full screen. 

A presentation of the basics of the model for Kenya is provided in presentations.
